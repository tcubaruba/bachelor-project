# Predicting Sales Pipeline for CRM Data Using Machine Learning Methods
The thesis can be found in ***Docs*** directory

## Installation & Preparations
I used ***pip*** as packet management system and provide a requirements.txt file to easily install all necessary libraries.  

Install pip with:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Navigate to the directory ***PythonScripts*** with:
```bash 
cd bachelor-project/Python_Scripts/
```

Install all python requirements with:
```bash 
pip3  install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the code
Navigate to the directory ***src*** with:
```bash 
cd src
```
Run the script with:
```bash 
python3 main.py
```
